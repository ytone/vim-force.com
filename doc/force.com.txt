                                                       *force.com-installation*

Installation/System requirements 

Before force.com plugin can be used following requirements must be met:

1. Vim version 7.3 or later with :set nocompatible
	There is a chance that it will work with 7.2 as well, but I have not tested

2. Java JDK/JRE, Version 6.1 or greater
   tested with OpenJDK and Oracle JDK
   - java version "1.6.0_18" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.8.10)
   - Oracle JDK
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

   JDK is not strictly required, JRE will suffice.
   With JRE Ant will complain about missing tools.jar but it is safe to ignore this warning


3. Apache ANT 
   tested with Apache Ant(TM) 
   - version 1.8.2 on Win XP SP3
   - version 1.8.0 on Linux
   - version 1.8.2 on OSX 10.8

4. Force.com Migration Tool  
    http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Migration_Tool
	Tested with salesforce_ant_19.0

    Download it as described here:
	http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/daas/index_Left.htm#StartTopic=Content/forcemigrationtool_install.htm

    ant-salesforce.jar library must be made available to ANT

    The order in which jars are added to the classpath is as follows:

    * -lib jars in the order specified by the -lib elements on the command line
    * jars from ${user.home}/.ant/lib (unless -nouserlib is set)
    * jars from ANT_HOME/lib

    see http://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html#libs for more details
    as well as
    http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_deploying_ant.htm

5. On MS Windows Install shortname.vim 
    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=433

6. Unpack force.com plugin archive anywhere you like

ex: ~/vim/force.com

7. Add 'force.com' folder to vim runtime path and make sure it loads apexcode filetype detection

e.g. >
	if has("unix")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',~/vim/force.com'
	elseif has("win32")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',c:\Documents and Settings\username\vimfiles\force.com'
	endif
	" make sure vim loads apexcode filetype detection
	runtime ftdetect/vim-force.com.vim
<

8. Enable filetype plugin and syntax highlighting

e.g. add these lines into .vimrc (or _vimrc on windows) >
	filetype plugin on
	syntax on
<

8. Index help file

e.g. >
    :helptags ~/vim/force.com/doc

<    Or if using with pathogen.vim plugin and force.com is in .vim/bundle run >
    :Helptags
<

USAGE                                                         *force.com-usage*

There are two ways to use force.com plugin
A.|apex-with-eclipse|                       Alongside Force.com IDE for Eclipse
B.|apex-plugin-standalone|                  Standalone, without Eclipse

Both methods assume that there is a <project-name>.properties file available
at the location specified by |'g:apex_properties_folder'|
See salesforce_migration_guide.pdf or 
http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/daas/index_Left.htm#StartTopic=Content/forcemigrationtool_connect.htm 
for details of .properties file.
Before moving next make sure to configure all global variables listed in |force.com-settings|

Project Setup and Structure                                *apex-project-setup*

	vim force.com plugin uses same project structure as Force.com IDE for Eclipse
		<eclipse project folder>
		--./src
		----./classes
		----./pages
		----./triggers
		----...

	So if you have existing eclipse project then you can start using force.com plugin
	straight away by opening .class or .trigger file with vim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Using alongside Force.com IDE for Eclipse                *apex-with-eclipse* 


	1. Create Force.com project with Eclipse as usual (selecting necessary metadata types)
	2. [optional] close Eclipse
	3. switch back to file system
	4. go to eclipse Eclipse workspace and locate folder of your project
	5. open any source class (.cls) file with vim
	
	at this point if class code is syntax highlighted then chances are that most of your 
	config is right
	
	6. issue command 
	   :ApexRefreshProject

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. vim force.com plugin standalone                     *apex-plugin-standalone*

In this mode Eclipse is not needed

 B.1. Creating new project
	- inside force.com plugin folder locate folder A-ProjectTemplate
	- copy A-ProjectTemplate to the location where you want your project
	  to reside and rename as desired, 
	  ex: '/home/user/projects/My Org (Sandbox)'
	- inside 'src/classes' folder locate A-Fake-Class.cls and open with Vim
	- Issue command:  
	  :ApexRefreshProject

 B.2. Adding Class/Page/Trigger
	- create relevant apex Class/Page/Trigger via force.com UI (Setup->Develop)
	- Run command
	  :ApexRefreshProject

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin exposes following commands:                              *apex-commands*

|ApexCompare|                       compare two projects
|ApexCompareWithPreRefreshVersion|  compare with pre refresh project state

|ApexStage|                         show/switch-to "Stage" buffer
|ApexStageAdd|                      add to Stage file in the current buffer
|ApexStageAddOpen|                  add to Stage files from all open buffers
|ApexStageRemove|                   remove from Stage file in the current buffer
|ApexStageClear|                    clear Stage buffer

|ApexDeploy|                        deploy project to SFDC
|ApexDeployConfirm|                 deploy with confirmation for each file
|ApexDeployOpen|                    deploy all open files
|ApexDeployAll|                     deploy all files in current project
|ApexDeployStaged|                  deploy all files listed in Stage cache
|ApexTest|                          run Unit Tests 

|ApexGitInit|                       initialise new Git repository for current 
                                    project
|ApexPrintChanged|                  display all modified files
|ApexRefreshFile|                   refresh current file from SFDC
|ApexRefreshProject|                refresh project from SFDC

|ApexTListToggle|                   toggle taglist (works if 'taglist' plugin 
                                    is installed)

|ApexNewFile|                       create new file

|ApexRetrieve|                      retrieve specified metadata types from server

|ApexRemoveStaged|                  remove Staged files from target SFDC ORG

|ApexLog|                           View last Ant log

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  *ApexCompare*
Imagine you have 2 sandboxes of the same Org and want to compare current file
with its counterpart in another sandbox

Example:
Assume following salesforce project folder structure
    .../some-path/sandbox 1/src
    .../some-path/prod org/src
'some-path' may be root of eclipse workspace or any other folder

':ApexCompare' will open durrectory selection dialogue
Assuming current project is 'sandbox 1' select 'prod org' folder and system will 
open specified (|'g:apex_diff_cmd'|) diff tool with both files 


                                             *ApexCompareWithPreRefreshVersion*
Every time before refresh from SFDC is executed system backs up modified files
from current project in the location specified by |'g:apex_backup_folder'|
Once refresh is complete it is possible to quickly open diff tool to compare
current file with its pre-refresh version.
Same as with |ApexCompare| you only have to pick top level folder of the
relevant backup i.e. parent of ./src/ folder, no need to drill down into
project subfolders.

                                                                  *ApexStage*
Stage is a temporary buffer which can be used as a stack to list files/metadata
types which will be used in subsequent Deploy/Remove operations.

Stage content can be manipulated either by commands like :|ApexStageAdd|,
:|ApexStageRemove|, :|ApexStageClear|, :|ApexStageAddOpen| or directly like any
other text buffer.  
Stage is persistent and retains its content between vim
editing sessions unless explicitly cleared.  If you use :Write command while in
Stage buffer, or just switch from Stage to another file/buffer, Stage content
will be automatically written to a disk file.
See also :|ApexRemoveStaged| and :|ApexDeployStaged|.

                                                                  *ApexStageAdd*
Add current file to |ApexStage|.

                                                              *ApexStageAddOpen*
Cycle through open buffers and add their files to |ApexStage|, provided that these
are supported apex file types.

                                                                  *ApexDeploy*
Use :|ApexDeploy| to upload/deploy/save all modified files of current project
to SFDC
All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support 2 optional arguments 
- deployment mode: normal deploy or 'checkOnly'
- 'project name' to deploy to.  This name should match file name part of
  .properties file which contains access details.
See |force.com-settings| for details about .properties files.
For example if I am working in "My Sandbox1" project and have 2 .properties files:
"My Sandbox 1.properties" and "My Sandbox 2.properties" then >
 :ApexDeploy
<will deploy by default using "My Sandbox 1.properties" file, while >
 :ApexDeploy My Sandbox 2
<will deploy files from current project using "My Sandbox 2.properties" file

Project name argument of all commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family supports completion.
For instance, using project names from the example above >
 :ApexDeploy checkOnly My<Tab>
< will offer "My Sandbox 1" and "My Sandbox 2"
                                                            *force.com-F11*
Plugin also defines keyboard shortcut F11 which calls :|ApexDeploy| and works
in 'normal' and 'insert' modes

                                                            *ApexDeployConfirm*
As opposed to |ApexDeploy| with |ApexDeployConfirm| system will ask for confirmation
to deploy every modified file to SFDC

                                                            *ApexDeployOpen*
Deploy/Save to SFDC all files open in current vim instance

                                                            *ApexDeployAll*
Deploy all files in current project.  This feature works reasonably well with
code files, custom labels, page layouts and many other metadata types but
suffers from the same limitations as salesforce library for Ant. 
For example - it will not create new Profiles. If profile already exist then it
will complain that it can not rename it, even if you are not trying to rename.
If there are Objects and Workflows in current project then SFDC may complain
that Objects have to be created before workflows, even if all objects already
exist in SFDC.

                                                            *ApexDeployStaged*
Deploy all files previously added by :|ApexStageAdd| command

                                                            *ApexTest*
Very basic function that is similar to :|ApexDeploy| but runs unit tests.  
If no class name specified then will run tests in all modified classes that
contain 'testMethod'.

By default no debug log is generated. Default Log level can be configured via
|'g:apex_test_logType'| variable.

:|ApexTest| supports command line parameters (and their completion)
Param: 1 - mode: 'testAndDeploy' or 'checkOnly', default 'testAndDeploy'
Param: 2 - class name - use this parameter to run only unit tests in a specific
           class
Param: 3 - method name - if test class contains several 'testMethod'-s then
           this parameter allows to specify single method to run. Body of all other
           methods will be skipped. This is particularly useful when you want to see log
           file from specific test and do not want other tests to pollute the log.
Param: 4 - target Org/project name. See :|ApexDeploy| for more details

Differences to :|ApexDeploy| 
- if you run :|ApexTest| and get unit tests failure(s) or insifficient overall
  code coverage then SFDC rejects changes and you files are NOT saved in SFDC.

                                                            *ApexGitInit*
If git is available then :|ApexGitInit| can be used to initialise new git
repository in current force.com project and add (with confirmation) existing
source files.
See apexUtil#gitInit() for the list of supported force.com project resources.
                                                            
                                                            *ApexPrintChanged*
Display changed files, i.e. candidates for deployment to SFDC.

                                                            *ApexRefreshFile*
Refresh current (single) file and replace it with its version from SFDC.

                                                            *ApexRefreshProject*
Refresh current project and download new/modified files from SFDC replacing
all local files.

                                                            *ApexTListToggle*
Helper for 'Tagist' plugin (http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.ne)
Taglist plugin does not support mixed filetypes like: apexcode.java 
so we have to trick it like if &filetype was = 'apexcode'
i.e. every time when Taglist is called set filetype=apexcode temporarely
and then revert back to what it was 
See apexcode.vim s:Apex_TList_Toggle() method for more details.

                                                            *ApexNewFile*
Invoke file types menu and create Apex file (class, trigger, etc). 
Not all files currently supported.
File will be created with API version defined by |g:apex_API_version| variable.

                                                            *ApexRetrieve*
Invoke metadata types list "menu" and load data of specified types.  
Usually :|ApexRefreshProject| will retrieve all types defined in package.xml.
:|ApexRetrieve| can be used to load types which are not part of current package.xml
Use this command when package.xml does not yet contain necessary metadata type(s).
If retrieved type is not part of the package.xml system will offer to
update package.xml accordingly. 
*WARNING* :|ApexRetrieve| command is Experimental. You may want to backup your
project before running :|ApexRetrieve|.

There are 2 potential scenarios which may involve :|ApexReteieve|
1. Load all members of given metadata type
   e.g. to load all Custom Objects you will do something like this >
	:ApexRetrieve
< then select CustomObjects line and then run >
	:Retrieve
<
2. Load selected members of given metadata type
   e.g. to load only Account metadata you will do something like this >
	:ApexRetrieve
< then select CustomObjects line and then run >
	:Expand
< then select Account and run >
	:Retrieve
<

                                                             *ApexRemoveStaged*
Delete staged files from current or specified Org. See |ApexStageAdd|.
Example 1: >
	:ApexRemoveStaged
< will remove all files listed in :ApexStage from the current Org
Example 2: >
	:ApexRemoveStaged My Other Org
< will remove staged files from "My Other Org"

                                                                     *ApexLog*
A basic shortcut to open log file generated by last Ant command.

SETTINGS                                                   *force.com-settings*

Before using force.com plgin following variables must be defined (ex: in .vimrc)
The plugin provides the following options that can customise the behaviour the
force.com plugin behaviour. These options should be set in your vimrc.

All of the examples below are for Unix environments. When defining paths for MS Windows 
use double slash, like this: >
	let g:apex_backup_folder="c:\\temp\\apex\\backup"
<

Required
|'g:apex_backup_folder'|          project backup folder
|'g:apex_temp_folder'|            temporary folder

|'g:apex_ctags_cmd'|                path to exuberant ctags 
|'g:apex_syntax_case_sensitive'|    defines whether Apex syntax highlighting is case sensitive 
|'g:apex_API_version'|              force.com API version to use when create new files, ex: 25.0
|'g:apex_pollWaitMillis'|           number of milliseconds to wait between each poll of Salesforce to retrieve the results
|'g:apex_test_logType'|             The debug logging level for tests. 

|apex-config-example|             .vimrc config example

                                                        *'g:apex_backup_folder'*

/path/to/folder where current project source is backed up before refresh from SFDC
Note, full path is required.
ex: 
	let g:apex_backup_folder="/tmp/apex/backup"

                                                          *'g:apex_temp_folder'*

Every time when ApexDeploy is called we copy files (to be fed to ANT job and deployed to sfdc) 
into /path/to/folder defined by g:apex_temp_folder
Note, full path is required.
ex: >
	let g:apex_temp_folder="/tmp/apex/gvim-deployment"
<
                                                  *'g:apex_deployment_error_log'*	

ANT error log file name which is stored in "g:apex_temp_folder
ex: >
	let g:apex_deployment_error_log="gvim-deployment-error.log"
<
                                                    *'g:apex_properties_folder'*	
Path to folder with *.property files which contain SFDC orgs access details
It is recommended to store those files in encrypted folder or partition.
Note, full path is required.
If path is incorrect then you will get error looking something like this: >
	BUILD FAILED
	/.../build.xml:57: Failed to login: Failed to send request to https://${dest.sf.serverurl}/services/Soap/u/...
<
Example below assumes that we are using Truecrypt

ex: >
	let g:apex_properties_folder="/media/truecrypt1"
<
or for win32, assuming that Truecrypt volume is T: >

                                                          *force.com-unix_utils*
Plugin is using unix utilities 'tee' and 'touch'
On MS Windows these commands are not available out of the box.
UnixUtils for Win32 can be found here: http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

See |'g:apex_binary_tee'| and |'g:apex_binary_touch'|
On Unix setting these variables is not strictly necessary, unless 'tee' and 'touch'
are not available via $PATH

Plugin also uses other built in shell commands like
'rm', 'mkdir', 'cp' on unix
and
'rmdir', 'copy' on ms windows
But it is assumed that these are generally available out of the box.
If you are using non standard environment then you can define paths to those commands.
See apexOs.vim for details

                                                            *'g:apex_binary_tee'*
Full path to shell command 'tee'
tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files

ex: >
	let g:apex_binary_tee = "/usr/bin/tee"
<or for win32 >
	let g:apex_binary_tee = "d:\\bin\\UnixUtils\\tee.exe"
<
                                                         *'g:apex_binary_touch'*
Full path to shell command 'touch'
tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files

ex: >
	let g:apex_binary_touch = "/usr/bin/touch"
<or for win32 >
	let g:apex_binary_touch = "d:\\bin\\UnixUtils\\touch.exe"
<
                                                             *'g:apex_diff_cmd'*
/path/to/file/compare/tool
ex: >
	let g:apex_diff_cmd="/usr/bin/meld"
<
If undefined then internal vimdiff will be used

                                                             *'g:apex_ctags_cmd'*
/path/to/exuberant/ctags/binary
ex: >
	let g:apex_ctags_cmd="/usr/local/bin/ctags"
<
If undefined then first available ctags binary will be used for tag generation

if ctags used to generate tag files then it is useful to add to your ~/.ctags file
following line:
--langmap=java:+.cls.trigger
this way we tell ctags to process Apex classes and triggers as Java files

                                                *'g:apex_syntax_case_sensitive'*
Use this variable to specify that Apex classes and triggers shall use case sensitive
syntax highlighting.
If not specified then Apex default is used - ignore case
ex: >
	let g:apex_syntax_case_sensitive = 1 " make syntax highlighting case sensitive
<

                                                          *'g:apex_API_version'*
Optional.
When commands like |ApexNewFile| generate new *-meta.xml file the 
<apiVersion>25.0</apiVersion> value is taken from 'g:apex_API_version' variable.
Set this variable to the necessary value if default does not meet your needs.
ex: >
	let g:apex_API_version="25.0"
<

                                                       *'g:apex_pollWaitMillis'*
Optional. 
Defaults to 1000. Sets pollWaitMillis for ant tasks. 
Number of milliseconds to wait between each poll of Salesforce to retrieve the
results. The smaller the value defined by 'g:apex_pollWaitMillis' the quicker
deploy will finish, but on slow connections larger values, like 10000 may be
necessary.
See ant-salesforce.jar documentation for 'pollWaitMillis' parameter.

                                                       *'g:apex_test_logType'*
Optional. 
Defaults to 'None'. The debug logging level for tests. 
Valid options are 'None', 'Debugonly', 'Db', 'Profiling', 'Callout', and 'Detail'.
See ant-salesforce.jar documentation for 'logType' parameter.

                                                           *apex-config-example*

FEATURES                                                   *force.com-features*

Build/Save to SFDC 
- with error reporting

Load/update metadata from SFDC

Create triggers/classes/pages

Refresh current file from SFDC

Refresh whole project from SFDC

Search
- find word in classes/triggers
- find word everywhere
- find visual selection

Syntax highlighting
- supports syntax highlighting of Apex Classes, Triggers, Pages, JS Resources

Basic Visualforce code completion
- try following in .page file (do not type single quote characters)
      '<' Ctrl-X,Ctrl-U
      '<apex:' Ctrl-X,Ctrl-U
      '<chatter' Ctrl-X,Ctrl-U

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                             *force.com-limitations*

vim force.com plugin does not support creating force.com project. Use provided
template instead.

ant-salesforce.jar library does not (in most cases) report error line numbers
in Visualforce pages making it impossible to go-to actual problem line if
compile/save fails due to syntax error. This is similar to Force.com IDE for
Eclipse.

Current version does not support environment aware code completion
For example if you write >
	String val = 'abc';
< typing >
	val.
< will not bring the list of String methods as Force.com IDE may do.

"Execute Anonymous" and "Run test" features are not implemented. Use your favourite 
web browser in the meantime.

On MS Windows default configuration spawns separate DOS/CMD window on every call
to command line utility, ex: ant deploy
It looks like there is a way to overcome this but I have not tried it
@see shell.vim - http://peterodding.com/code/vim/shell/

==============================================================================
RECOMMENDED-PLUGINS                             *force.com-recommended-plugins*
